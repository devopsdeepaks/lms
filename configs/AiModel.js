Key concepts include:\n        *   What is Flutter?\n        *   What is Dart?\n        *   What is a Widget?\n        *   Stateless vs. Stateful Widgets.\n        *   `main()` function and `runApp()`.\n        *   Hot Reload/Hot Restart.\n        *   Build context.\n    *   **User Interface (UI) Development:** This involves building the visual part. Key concepts include:\n        *   Common layout widgets (Row, Column, Stack, Container).\n        *   Common UI widgets (Text, Image, Icon, Button).\n        *   Styling (TextStyle, ThemeData).\n        *   Scaffold widget.\n        *   AppBar.\n        *   Handling user input (e.g., `onPressed`).\n    *   **Basic App Navigation:** Moving between screens. Key concepts include:\n        *   `Navigator`.\n        *   `MaterialPageRoute`.\n        *   `Navigator.push()`.\n        *   `Navigator.pop()`.\n        *   Routes (named vs. anonymous).\n\n3.  **Brainstorm Flashcard Ideas (Mixing Topics):**\n    *   What is Flutter? -> Google's UI toolkit...\n    *   What language does Flutter use? -> Dart.\n    *   What is the basic building block in Flutter UI? -> Widget.\n    *   Difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets? -> State management.\n    *   What's the function to start a Flutter app? -> `runApp()`.\n    *   What does Hot Reload do? -> Injects code without losing state.\n    *   What's a common widget for basic app structure (app bar, body)? -> `Scaffold`.\n    *   How do you arrange widgets horizontally? -> `Row`.\n    *   How do you arrange widgets vertically? -> `Column`.\n    *   How do you display text? -> `Text` widget.\n    *   How do you create a clickable button? -> `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, etc. (Need `onPressed`).\n    *   How do you navigate to a new screen? -> `Navigator.push()`.\n    *   How do you go back to the previous screen? -> `Navigator.pop()`.\n    *   What class is often used with `Navigator.push` to define the new screen? -> `MaterialPageRoute`.\n    *   What is `BuildContext`? -> Location in the widget tree.\n    *   How do you add padding or margin? -> `Padding` widget or `Container`'s `padding`/`margin`. (Let's stick to `Container` for simplicity or `Padding` widget).\n    *   What widget overlays children? -> `Stack`.\n    *   How to display an image? -> `Image.asset()` or `Image.network()`.\n    *   What's the top bar in a `Scaffold` called? -> `AppBar`.\n\n4.  **Select and Refine (Targeting ~15):** Review the brainstormed list, combine similar ideas, prioritize fundamental concepts, and ensure coverage across the three specified areas. Aim for clear, concise questions and answers.\n\n    *   Q: What is Flutter? A: Google's UI toolkit... (Keep)\n    *   Q: Language for Flutter? A: Dart. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Basic building block? A: Widget. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Stateless vs. Stateful? A: Immutable vs. Mutable state. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Starting function? A: `runApp()`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Hot Reload vs Hot Restart? A: State preserved vs. State lost. (Good distinction) (Keep)\n    *   Q: Basic app structure widget? A: `Scaffold`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Horizontal layout? A: `Row`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Vertical layout? A: `Column`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Display text? A: `Text` widget. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Clickable button? A: E.g., `ElevatedButton` with `onPressed`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Go to new screen? A: `Navigator.push()`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Go back? A: `Navigator.pop()`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: Route definition for push? A: `MaterialPageRoute`. (Keep)\n    *   Q: What is `BuildContext`? A: Handle to widget's location. (Keep)\n    *   *Adding one more:*\n    *   Q: Widget for padding/margin/color? A: `Container`. (Useful UI widget)\n\n5.  **Format as JSON:** Structure the selected Q&A pairs into the required JSON format: an array `[]` containing objects `{}`, each with `\"front\"` and `\"back\"` keys.\n\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"front\": \"What is Flutter?\",\n        \"back\": \"An open-source UI toolkit by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"front\": \"What programming language does Flutter use?\",\n        \"back\": \"Dart, an object-oriented language also developed by Google.\"\n      },\n      // ... continue for all selected cards\n    ]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Review and Verify:**\n    *   **Count:** Check if the number of cards is <= 15. (Currently 16, need to remove or combine one. Let's remove the `BuildContext` one as it's slightly more advanced than the others for *basic* fundamentals). Now 15. Perfect.\n    *   **Format:** Ensure valid JSON structure (commas between objects, quotes around keys and string values).\n    *   **Content:** Confirm accuracy and clarity of front/back text. Ensure topics (Fundamentals, UI, Navigation) are covered.\n    *   **Clarity:** Are the questions clear? Are the answers concise and correct? Yes.\n\n7.  **Final JSON Output:** Generate the final JSON string based on the refined list and structure."},
